	\paragraph {Brief Introduction}

Agricultural market is an important economical market for human beings that exists for many years. This market help farmers sell their crops to people so that people are able to gain enough food. It is one of the earliest markets for people to develop information exchange, because farmers use the market to know how great demand in some agricultural products has potential by observing the agricultural trading in the market. As time goes by, computer science grows rapidly today. The knowledge of computer science could cause a big impact on agricultural market. It is good for us to combine a mature market and new skills together which help develop the modern agricultural market today.

	\paragraph {Brief Introduction}

According to the guideline of ENGG1813 Engineering Critical Thinking, it is a unit focus on the rigors of communication in an engineering context including technical writing, teamwork, formal presentations and critical analysis. Critical thinking is a compound thinking tool that people use logic and its related skills to make secondary evaluation of a series of thinking, such as viewpoint, judgment, proposition, argument, etc. At present, the lack of critical thinking in engineering education is related to the shallow problem consciousness, weak professional interest and weak practical ability in engineering talent training. Therefore, it is necessary for engineering students to learn Engineering critical thinking.

	\paragraph {Which field it pertains to?}

The elective (ENGG1813 Engineering Critical Thinking) is from the Faculty of Engineering to USYD’s standard of classifification. Briefly, it is under the table s electives- Engineering.

	\paragraph {What core knowledge it has?}

By studying this unit, we can master various knowledge mentioned below.

Critical thinking is the inherent requirement of cultivating engineering innovative talents. Critical thinking, which refers to the logical thinking ability that can grasp the main points, be good at questioning, discriminating, strictly inferring, rich in wit, clear and agile. The essence of the difference of people's quality is not the difference of their knowledge and information, but the difference of their thinking ability. The critical thinking of cultivating engineering talents is to explore and practice effective ways to reveal and train the differences of this ability, and cultivate them into high-quality innovative talents.

Engineering innovation should complete the knowledge inheritance, and on this basis, be able to carry out engineering innovation and solve new problems in engineering practice.

Engineering students can not only solve new problems, but also carry out process innovation in engineering creation which is related to the critical thinking.

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

This unit is suitable for students who major in data science because it can assist the study of data science. When students majoring in data science look for errors in experiments, it is easy to leave out details, such as selection bias, observer bias and etc. Besides, data science students should beware of clean data syndrom and not give into the fallacies with the use of critical thinking. Under such circumstances, mastering a skill of engineering critical thinking is essential.

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

It is obvious that ENGG1813 Engineering Critical Thinking is useful for our data science students in various senses. For the future career, students majoring in data science can engaged in big data management, research and application development in government agencies, enterprises and companies.$^{[1]}$ At the same time, we can get postgraduate students majoring in software engineering, computer science and technology, and applied statistics or go abroad for further study. Generally, graduates step into those jobs related to the data science major will have more promotion space, and as a compound talent, they will get better development, and their business ability will be better.

	\paragraph {What opportunities it can bring for us in the future?}

In the future, the trend of multidisciplinary crossing is inevitable. Data Science is merely a powerful tool, or a compelling concept. There must be an appropriate object to use it, and engineering is the special one. Demand for big data and accurate measurement is increasing, thereforing learning this unit is bound to obtain work opportunities for data scientists.

	\paragraph {Brief Introduction}

According to the guideline of ECON1001 Introductory Microeconomics, it is a unit of introduction to Microeconomics related to the economic decisions based on individual company and households and how they interact in markets with each other. It is common knowledge that economic problems have frequent impact on Australian society. Introductory Microeconomics lead students to explore the language and analytical framework adopted in Economics for the  social phenomenon and public policy issues. Whatever one's career intentions, coming to grips with economic ideas is essential for understanding society, business and government. Students are given a comprehensive introduction to these ideas and are prepared for the advanced study of microeconomics in subsequent years. Prior knowledge of mathematics is assumed.
	
	\paragraph {Which field it pertains to?}

The elective (ECON1001 Introductory Microeconomics) is from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences according to the classification of University of Sydney standard. Briefly, it is under the table s electives- Economy.$^{[4]}$

	\paragraph {What core knowledge it has?}

By studying this unit, we can master various knowledge mentioned below.$^{[4]}$
Microeconomics is an economic theory that studies the economic behavior of a single economic unit in a society and how the single value of the corresponding economic variable is determined, and analyzes the economic behavior of an individual economic unit.

	\paragraph {What abilities can it improve?}
	
Learning outcomes are provided here.

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Application the economic concepts into practice.
	  \item Critically estimate the hypothesis or real issues.
	\end{itemize}

	\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Extra Explanation}}

For LO1, after understanding the equilibrium price theory, consumer behavior theory, producer behavior theory (including production theory, cost theory and market equilibrium theory), distribution theory, general equilibrium theory and welfare economics, market failure and microeconomics policy, we can apply them into our real life problems to deal with decision making.

For LO2, when we meet with problems, with the knowledge of microeconomics, we can take the limitation and benefit both into consideration to find out a solution.

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

The knowledge in this unit can be certain useful tool for a students who major in data science because it can assist the study of data science. For example, microeconomics can help data science learner understand consumers' decisions and enterprises make strategic decisions (supply chain) according to consumers' react.

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

As is said in the unit outlines of the unit, whatever one's career intentions, coming to grips with economic ideas is essential for understanding society, business and government. 

In terms of future career path, Econ1001 can also be helpful, broadening students’ horizons and providing them with more options and opportunities to select the most suitable jobs.$^{[1]}$ I have mentioned previously that learning microeconomics enables students to see how data science can be utilized for business models and assist precise decision making. Taking microeconomics can also help students to take a peek into the financial and economics disciplines. Considering the amount of data science and data analytics needed in the field of financial market and economics researches, taking microeconomics may be helpful for students to discover a new career interest and have more choices. Data science as an academic discipline is far more than just the knowledge of data. It has great implications in a broad range of career paths, and for students majoring in data science to be successful, they need to know not only data science, but also have a comprehensive understanding in the field that they utilize their data science expertise in. Therefore, microeconomics can be a very sound choice for more opportunities and a broader career path.

	\paragraph {What opportunities it can bring for us in the future?}

An economic course can provide great opportunities about multidisciplinary fields like EC (electronic commerce). Also, Yale University set a combined subject concerning computing and economy in 2019, which means the relationship between these two subjects are no more alienated.

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

This unit is definitely useful for students who major in Information System, for the unit's core topic is enterprise systems. We can draw lessons from this unit to construct information system on our own. Moreover, there are many similarities between information system and enterprise system. Enterprise system is made of active and dynamic people, while information system is made of static codes. Hence, in some aspects, it is easier to master the static one than the dynamic one. Elements like field control systems are worth studying in information system.

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

After graduation, the majority of us will go to an enterprise for a job (solely a little will settle down in government apartments, self-operated companies).$^{[1]}$ Hence, familiar with how enterprises work will enhance our understanding of where we are and what we are going to do. For example, we can save time and energy while cooperation if we are familiar with the structure of an enterprise; we will know the correct place to ask for assistence when trapped. 

	\paragraph {What opportunities it can bring for us in the future?}

In the future, rapidly increasing technology is an inevitable trend. While some technology may well be confronted with dispute, studying this unit offering us an opportunity to demarcate brand new technology and distinguish the potential ones from mortal ones under the guidance of philosophic ideas.

What distinguishes creationism from evolutionary theory, or astrology from astronomy? Can we have good reason to believe that our current scientific theories represent the world "as it really is"? For those people who are immersed in philosophical thinking and reflection, such questions are bound to emerge often in their mind. As students of Advanced Computing, I do admit that learning how to master programming languages, structures,  algorithm and some other basic elements in computing is undoubtedly the top priority. However, we should not rest content with these technologies. Why does computing matter? What is computing’s true features? What are statistics, software and information, if we evaluate them at the level of human development? These questions are really worth studying and once we find appropriate answers, it will enhance our understanding of computing and assist us to innovate and reform in this field.

	\paragraph {Which field it pertains to?}

This elective is from an academic unit named ‘History and Philosophy of Science Academic Operations' according to USYD’s standard of classification. Generally, it is supposed to be classified in the field of History and Philosophy.$^{[7]}$

	\paragraph {What core knowledge it has?} 

In this unit, we can acquire some knowledge below (For this unit is a completely liberal one, there is not any corresponding technology, contrary to some scientific units).$^{[7]}$
 
\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Basic Introduction}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Empiricism}}

This is the most basic part in this unit, mainly introducing the structure and form. Empiricism is the first academic definition we will meet. We will deeply study its content, including development history and methodology, and the relationship to Rationalism.
 
\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Logical Positivism}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Problems of Confirmation}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Karl Popper's Falsificationism}}

This is the chapter of Positivism, containing the definition, problems in methodology and famous views. We will deeply study the stage of the development of human reason (Positivism is the highest one), the concrete process while confirmation and the fantastic view ‘Scientific theories are falsifiable in principle.’ raised by Karl Popper\footnote{(28 July 1902 – 17 September 1994) an Austrian-British philosopher, academic and social commentator, known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification.}. 

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{The Problem of Demarcation}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{The Case of Creation Science}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Thomas Kuhn's Revolution}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Responses to Kuhn}}

This is the chapter of demarcation, containing problems, typical cases and a famous revolutionary theory along with its response. We will deeply study how to demarcate objects, especially science in a professional and peer-reviewed way. Moreover, we will learn ‘Science consists of a series of paradigms separated by abrupt scientific revolutions.’, a theory raised by Thomas Kuhn\footnote{(July 18, 1922 – June 17, 1996) an American philosopher of science, known for his 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in both academic and popular circles.} and its corresponding responses. 

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Sociology of Scientific Knowledge}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Values, Objectivity and Social Critiques of Science}}

The scientific elements begin to ascend in this chapter. This is the chapter of sociology. We will focus on the basic attributes of science, containing values, objectivity and social critiques, the role of values in science and sociological approaches to understanding science. Claim that science cannot really be distinguished from other approaches to knowledge is also the significant study content in this chapter. 

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Relativism and Anti-realism}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Realism and Experiment}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Scientific Explanation}}

This is the chapter of realism. We will learn how to distinguish correct methodologies in experiments and explanations form wrong ones. This is of vital essence for our future development in scientific fields. 

	\paragraph {What abilities it can improve?}

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Be capable of understanding philosophical and historical discussions of science and critically assess arguments in these areas.
	  \item Be capable of writing clear and well-organized responses to philosophical and historical discussions of science, and develop your own views on these issues (which is a liberal learning outcome).
	  \item Be capable of relating general philosophical and historical ideas about science to particular examples of scientific work in a gesture to rapidly form a complete guidance for us to finish the work.
	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

This unit is not particularly designed for students who major in Software Development, but it teaches the guiding ideology when we are conducting research into computing. As the famous scientist Descartes\marginpar{\textcolor{blue}{\tiny French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist}} stated, if knowledge is a tree, philosophy will be the root and science will be the branch. Science is appropriate only when it adhere to the guidance of philosophy. Hence, acquaintance with philosophy will take us to a higher platform; there we are capable of getting a bird's-eye view of science’s true features. Moreover, concentrated on Software Development, it is a practical field, because all the objects are attained from concrete social demand and all the responses are oriented towards the society. Hence, the content about Sociology of Science, Realism, Demarcation and other scientific elements works. 

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

As I stated just now, this unit is extremely helpful in our future career. No matter what we are about to do, scientific research, IT enterprise management, or professional programming, we need to have a clear understanding of what we are doing and why we are doing in this way, rather than solely mastering cutting-edge technology without knowing the meaning of our course. 

	\paragraph {What opportunities it can bring for us in the future?}

In the future, rapidly increasing technology is an inevitable trend. While some technology may well be confronted with dispute, studying this unit offering us an opportunity to demarcate brand new technology and distinguish the potential ones from mortal ones under the guidance of philosophic ideas.$^{[1]}$

	\caption{Design}
	\end{figure}

	\paragraph {Brief Introduction}

Have you ever paid attention to categories of design? If so, have you ever focused on human-centred spirits? What would occur if these two definitions combine together? For people who are not involved in design, they may regard design as a complete art. However, design also needs the support of precise theories and rigorous analysis. Real design is the design of interactive technologies and environments, which requires user research, ideation, prototyping and user evaluation.It provides us with the principles, processes and tools that are used in commercial design projects. We can learn to build empathy with users, identify the problem space, develop design concepts and persuasively communicate design proposals with an emphasis on the user experience through visual storytelling.

	\paragraph {Which field it pertains to?}

This elective is from an academic unit named ‘Design Lab' according to USYD’s standard of classification. Generally, it is supposed to be classified in the combined field of art and technology.$^{[8]}$

	\paragraph {What core knowledge it has?} 

In this unit, we can acquire some knowledge and technology below.$^{[8]}$
 
\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Basic Introduction}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Visual Thinking}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Design as a Process}}

This is the most basic part in this unit, mainly introducing the visual thinking and the definition of "design as a process". Visual thinking is of vital essence in the whole unit, often described as seeing words as a series of pictures. One of the ultimate goals of this unit is to design as a real picture thinkers\footnote{"Real picture thinkers" are those who use visual thinking almost to the exclusion of other kinds of thinking, make up a smaller percentage of the population.According to Kreger Silverman, three tenths of the general population who use visual/spatial thinking, only a small percentage would use this style over and above all other forms of thinking, and can be said to be "real picture thinkers"}.
 
\centerline {\textcolor{red}{User Research}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Data Synthesis}}

This is the chapter of User Research, containing the research and the subsequent data synthesis. We will deeply study the concrete process of the user research, including deciding research objects, designing user factor frameworks, analyzing feasibility and designing questionnaires. Moreover, the following data synthesis is the conclusion and summary of the former research, and the foundation of the future design evaluation. 

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Generating Ideas}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Prototyping}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Design Evaluation}}

This is the chapter of Design Evaluation, containing generating ideas, prototyping and the evaluation. We will deeply study how to generate ideas, especially when information and data we possess is not complete, create the prototypes of the design and evaluate design in several aspects, including the readability of information, artistic styles and so forth. 

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{TBC}}

\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Future of design}}

This chapter enables us to complete the design and provides us with suggestions about details in TBC.

	\paragraph {What abilities it can improve?}

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Engage in contextual inquiry to identify the need for a design
	  \item Show competence in design ideation
	  \item Communicate ideas and concepts visually
	  \item Apply knowledge of the psychology of user experience to designing interactive systems
	  \item Describe and explain activities associated with a design project
	  \item Reflect upon and critique design activities using appropriate language
	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

This unit has strong relationship with students who major in Software Development, for software development is actually a process of design. Codes and algorithm matter, but they are all dependent on the initial creativity. Only when developers acquaint the demand and general idea can they carry on typing codes and fulfil the framework in a computing aspect. Hence, acquaintance with design will allow us to self-develop software, no more support from the designers, which means from the design idea of software to the computing structure of that, all this process can be dealt with one person or computational team.

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

As I stated just now, this unit is extremely helpful in our future career. As long as we develop software, design matters, because if we only know how to codes, it would be extremely likely that we be weeded out by artificial intelligence. The design idea is what we human are expert at and what AI would hardly get to know.

	\paragraph {What opportunities it can bring for us in the future?}

In the future, acquaintance with design will allow us to self-develop software, no more support from the designers, which means from the design idea of software to the computing structure of that, all this process can be dealt with one person or computational team.

	\section{Contributions}

	\subsection{Group Management}
	
	\paragraph{General introduction}

Our group has been working and studying together since Project 1, so in this stage, we have already formed a very mature management system. 

First, we set a member as the leader, who takes charge of all things in the team, including weekly conferences, submission audit, co-ordination and so forth. He will set standard of work and the due date of personal mission.

Second, we set a member in charge of attendance of weekly conferences. He will inform each member to attend conferences on time in advance, and report to the team leader if someone cannot attend the conference. The leader will decide whether hold the conference as usual or not according to the number of members who are able to come.

Third, we set a member in charge of Git repository. He will focus on our Git repository all the time, and check whether there are new files or codes pushed. If so, he will update the version or merge the branch in time. When confronted with conflicts, he will ask the submitter to re-check the file or codes and tackle the conflicts.

Finally, we set a member in charge of the final check of work. She is expert at LaTeX and report-writing. Hence, she will check the ".tex" file and the content to find if there are grammar mistakes or misunderstandings. She is the quality safeguard of our team.

	\subsection{Group Working Method}

	\paragraph{Weekly Conference}

This is the main working method of our team. We almost discuss everything in conferences. We can study the template; we can discuss about the reasonability of recommendations; we can exchange our findings in personal research; we can set the standard of work and corresponding due date. Weekly conferences allow us to tackle 90\% of problems.

	\paragraph{Wechat discussion}

This is the supplement for conferences. If we fail to tackle some problems or even discover them, we will then discuss in Wechat\footnote{a Chinese multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app developed by Tencent}.

	\paragraph{Git Feedback}

This is a special conversation method. If the member who is in charge of Git repository find something wrong in GitHub, he will provide feedback to the corresponding cooperator.

	\subsection{Challenges}

Since we four members are really familiar with each other, there are rare chanllenges during the process of cooperation. Solely one chanllenge is worth attaching importance to. For this project is conducted in May, which is an accepted "Project Month" of USYD, large quantities of projects and assignments are in our schedule. Hence, a due date which is set in a weekly conference may have conflicts to some certain member's schedule. At this time, the leader always postpone the due date in order to cater to each member. However, unprincipled postponement is bound to result in burning the midnight oil before real due date.

	\subsection{Solutions}

The leader should have a clear statement of each member's duties and responsibilities. If they cannot submit work before due date, the leader should in large extent supervise and urge him/her to study and research efficiently, rather than just postponing the due date. This does not mean postponement is impossible, but at least it should not be casual.

	\subsection{Work Distribution}

Work distribution in our group is quite even for each member. They respectively research 2 electives for the allocated major and act as a critical in the team. Bill Liang is the member in charge of attendance of weekly conferences. Kaizhen Li is expert at Git, therefore in charge of Git repository. Zhen Luo is the quality safeguard of our team who takes charge of reports and LaTeX. Zhenlin Liu is the leader of this team.

	\subsection{Contribution of each member}

Bill Liang takes charge of 4.1 (Recommendations - Computer Science); Kaizhen Li takes charge of 4.3 (Recommendations - Information Systems); Zhen Luo takes charge of 4.2 (Recommendations - Data Science); Zhenlin Liu takes charge of the rest(Group Information + Introduction + Major Allocation + Recommendations - Software Development + Contributions + References). For Zhenlin Liu is the leader of this team, the main part of this report is written by him. That is the result of members' decision.
