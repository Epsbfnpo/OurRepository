	\paragraph {Brief Introduction}

Agricultural market is an important economical market for human beings that exists for many years. This market help farmers sell their crops to people so that people are able to gain enough food. It is one of the earliest markets for people to develop information exchange, because farmers use the market to know how great demand in some agricultural products has potential by observing the agricultural trading in the market. As time goes by, computer science grows rapidly today. The knowledge of computer science could cause a big impact on agricultural market. It is good for us to combine a mature market and new skills together which help develop the modern agricultural market today.

Critical thinking is the inherent requirement of cultivating engineering innovative talents. Critical thinking, which refers to the logical thinking ability that can grasp the main points, be good at questioning, discriminating, strictly inferring, rich in wit, clear and agile. The essence of the difference of people's quality is not the difference of their knowledge and information, but the difference of their thinking ability. The critical thinking of cultivating engineering talents is to explore and practice effective ways to reveal and train the differences of this ability, and cultivate them into high-quality innovative talents.

Engineering innovation should complete the knowledge inheritance, and on this basis, be able to carry out engineering innovation and solve new problems in engineering practice.

Engineering students can not only solve new problems, but also carry out process innovation in engineering creation which is related to the critical thinking.

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Application the economic concepts into practice.
	  \item Critically estimate the hypothesis or real issues.
	\end{itemize}

	\centerline {\textcolor{red}{Extra Explanation}}

For LO1, after understanding the equilibrium price theory, consumer behavior theory, producer behavior theory (including production theory, cost theory and market equilibrium theory), distribution theory, general equilibrium theory and welfare economics, market failure and microeconomics policy, we can apply them into our real life problems to deal with decision making.

For LO2, when we meet with problems, with the knowledge of microeconomics, we can take the limitation and benefit both into consideration to find out a solution.

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

The knowledge in this unit can be certain useful tool for a students who major in data science because it can assist the study of data science. For example, microeconomics can help data science learner understand consumers' decisions and enterprises make strategic decisions (supply chain) according to consumers' react.

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

As is said in the unit outlines of the unit, whatever one's career intentions, coming to grips with economic ideas is essential for understanding society, business and government. 

In terms of future career path, Econ1001 can also be helpful, broadening students’ horizons and providing them with more options and opportunities to select the most suitable jobs. I have mentioned previously that learning microeconomics enables students to see how data science can be utilized for business models and assist precise decision making. Taking microeconomics can also help students to take a peek into the financial and economics disciplines. Considering the amount of data science and data analytics needed in the field of financial market and economics researches, taking microeconomics may be helpful for students to discover a new career interest and have more choices. Data science as an academic discipline is far more than just the knowledge of data. It has great implications in a broad range of career paths, and for students majoring in data science to be successful, they need to know not only data science, but also have a comprehensive understanding in the field that they utilize their data science expertise in. Therefore, microeconomics can be a very sound choice for more opportunities and a broader career path.

	\paragraph {What opportunities it can bring for us in the future?}

An economic course can provide great opportunities about multidisciplinary fields like EC (electronic commerce). Also, Yale University set a combined subject concerning computing and economy in 2019, which means the relationship between these two subjects are no more alienated.

	\paragraph {How it helps the major?}

This unit is definitely useful for students who major in Information System, for the unit's core topic is enterprise systems. We can draw lessons from this unit to construct information system on our own. Moreover, there are many similarities between information system and enterprise system. Enterprise system is made of active and dynamic people, while information system is made of static codes. Hence, in some aspects, it is easier to master the static one than the dynamic one. Elements like field control systems are worth studying in information system.

	\paragraph {How it helps the career?}

After graduation, the majority of us will go to an enterprise for a job (solely a little will settle down in government apartments, self-operated companies). Hence, familiar with how enterprises work will enhance our understanding of where we are and what we are going to do. For example, we can save time and energy while cooperation if we are familiar with the structure of an enterprise; we will know the correct place to ask for assistence when trapped.
